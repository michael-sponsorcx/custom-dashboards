# Project Rules and Guidelines

## Package Management

**IMPORTANT:** This project uses **Yarn** as its package manager, NOT npm.

- Use `yarn` commands for all package management operations
- Use `yarn add <package>` to install dependencies (not `npm install`)
- Use `yarn remove <package>` to remove dependencies (not `npm uninstall`)
- Use `yarn build`, `yarn test`, etc. for running scripts
- Never use `npm` commands in this project
